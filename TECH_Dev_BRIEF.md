## ðŸš€ Feature Implementation Roadmap

Once stability is achieved, implement features in this order:

### Phase 1: Enhanced Gang System + Core Features

**Work Command Enhancement:**
- Implement role-based DLZ earning rates:
  - Gang members: Base rate (1x multiplier)
  - Lieutenants: Enhanced rate (1.5x multiplier) 
  - Gang leaders: Maximum rate (2x multiplier)
- Add cooldown variations based on gang position
- Include random events during work (robberies, police encounters, bonus finds)

**Advanced Hierarchy & Roles:**
- Gang leadership structure with delegated permissions
- Role-based command access (boss can promote, lieutenants can invite, members can participate)
- Gang reputation system affecting event outcomes and available activities

**Database Schema Updates:**
```sql
-- Add to gangs table
ALTER TABLE gangs ADD COLUMN roles JSONB;
ALTER TABLE gangs ADD COLUMN reputation INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE gangs ADD COLUMN territory VARCHAR(100);

-- New table
CREATE TABLE gang_assets (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    gang_id INTEGER REFERENCES gangs(id),
    asset_type VARCHAR(50),
    metadata JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE gang_alliances (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    gang1_id INTEGER REFERENCES gangs(id),
    gang2_id INTEGER REFERENCES gangs(id),
    status VARCHAR(20), -- pending, active, broken
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**New Commands:**
- `!gang promote <user> <role>` - Assign roles (boss/lieutenant/member)
- `!gang demote <user>` - Remove role privileges
- `!gang asset add <type> <data>` - Manage gang resources (weapons, hideouts, businesses)
- `!gang alliance propose <gang>` - Form strategic alliances
- `!gang territory claim <area>` - Expand gang influence
- `!gang reputation` - Check gang's standing in the community

### Phase 2: Prison System & Player Interactions

**Automatic Imprisonment Triggers:**
- **Failed theft attempts:** Stealing from other members with failure chance
- **Lost combat:** Losing fights or duels against other players
- **Wrong random event choices:** Poor decisions in automated situations
- **Gang war defeats:** Losing important gang battles
- **Rule violations:** Staff-triggered imprisonment for misconduct

**Prison Mechanics:**
- **Automatic imprisonment:** Failed heists, negative random events, rule violations, failed theft attempts, lost combat
- **Channel restrictions:** Prisoners get "prisoner" role, access ONLY to #prison channel in CARCERAL category (blocked from all other channels)
- **Temporary sentence system:** Determined duration based on offense severity
- **Prison activities:** 
  - Work opportunities for sentence reduction
  - Random events affecting sentence length (can extend OR reduce time)
  - Small jobs available to earn limited DLZ while imprisoned
- **Visitor system:** 
  - Other members request visits by using command
  - Request appears to prisoner in #prison channel
  - Prisoner must accept visit request to allow chat
  - Visitors can chat with prisoner in #prison channel for limited time
- **Legal system:** 
  - Prisoner can request lawyer assistance
  - Prisoner can make public plea (appears in general chat for all members to see)
  - Public pleas allow community to vote on early release
  - Minimum 5 community members must react to decide liberation
  - Democratic voting system for prisoner release decisions
- **Release mechanisms:**
  - Automatic release when sentence expires
  - Early release through community voting (5+ votes required)
  - Staff administrative release
  - Successful completion of rehabilitation programs

**Player-to-Player Interaction System:**
```python
# player_interactions.py
class PlayerInteraction:
    def __init__(self):
        self.interaction_types = {
            'steal': {'success_rate': 0.6, 'cooldown': 4*3600, 'daily_limit': 5},
            'fight': {'success_rate': 0.5, 'cooldown': 6*3600, 'daily_limit': 3},
            'duel': {'success_rate': 0.5, 'cooldown': 12*3600, 'daily_limit': 2},
            'gift': {'success_rate': 1.0, 'cooldown': 3600, 'daily_limit': 10}
        }
```

**Interaction Consequences Matrix:**
- **Successful Theft:** +200-500 DLZ to thief, -100-300 DLZ to victim
- **Failed Theft:** Thief goes to prison (2-6 hours), victim gets compensation
- **Won Fight:** +300 DLZ, reputation boost, potential gang rank improvement
- **Lost Fight:** -200 DLZ, possible imprisonment, reputation damage
- **Successful Duel:** Winner takes agreed stakes, loser loses all
- **Random Event Failures:** Automatic imprisonment (1-8 hours depending on severity)
